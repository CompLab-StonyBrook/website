<p>The <a href="http://linguistics.stonybrook.edu">Department of Linguistics</a> at <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu">Stony Brook University</a> offers a 3-semester <span class="caps">M.A.</span> in Computational Linguistics.</p>
<p>Computational linguistics is the study of language as a computational problem.
There are two sides to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Applications: Getting computers to solve language-related tasks</em><br>
    This includes voice recognition, machine translation, chatbots, automatic text generation and summarization, web search, ad placement, stylistic analysis, and much more.</br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Science: Computational analysis of language</em><br>
    The human brain is a highly sophisticated computer that is capable of effortlessly solving very complex tasks.
    By investigating what computations humans must be carrying out when they use language, we learn new techniques for solving language-related problems with computers.</br></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both sides of computational linguistics have seen an enormous boom in recent years.
Computational linguists are highly sought after in industry, and more and more positions in academia require a strong computational background.
Our <span class="caps">M.A.</span> program in Computational Linguistics is designed to prepare students from a wide range of backgrounds for future careers in this booming field, be it as natural language engineers, data analysts, or as the first step towards a Ph.D. in Computational Linguistics.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h2>
<p>For admission to the <span class="caps">M.A.</span> program in Computational Linguistics, the following are normally required:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Baccalaureate degree</strong><br>
    A baccalaureate degree is required.
    Students must present evidence that such a degree will be awarded by the time they begin graduate work.
    A final transcript is also required prior to registration.</br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cumulative <span class="caps">GPA</span> &gt; 3.0</strong><br>
    A minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (or its foreign equivalent) on a four-point scale.
    If you have attended graduate school and obtained a master’s degree, and the <span class="caps">GPA</span> is over 3.00, then the <span class="caps">GPA</span> of the undergraduate school can be below 3.00 for regular admission.</br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Three (3) letters of recommendation</strong><br>
    Letters of recommendation from three former instructors are required.
    If the applicant already has pertinent work experience, e.g. as part of a software development team, some of these letters can also be from employers who are qualified to comment on the candidate’s qualifications.</br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Graduate Record Examination (<span class="caps">GRE</span>)</strong><br>
    There is no subject test for computational linguistics; the general test is all that is required.
    Please have the testing service send a copy of your score to the Linguistics Department.</br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Writing sample</strong><br>
    The writing sample may take one of two forms:</br></p>
<ol>
<li>a short paper written for a previous course, ideally related to language, mathematics, or computation, or</li>
<li>a 2-page document describing a completed or ongoing programming project, including a link to an online repository hosting the code.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Curriculum Vitae or Resume</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><span class="caps">TOEFL</span> Score</strong><br>
    Non-native speakers of English must have obtained a minimum score of 600 (paper), 250 (computer), or 100 (iBT) on the <span class="caps">TOEFL</span> test.</br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptance</strong><br>
    Students must be accepted by both the Department of Linguistics and the Graduate School.</br></p>
</li>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="character-of-the-program">Character of the program</h3>
<p><strong>Why Stony Brook?</strong><br>
There are several computational linguistics programs across the country.
The program at Stony Brook distinguishes itself through a unique philosophy.</br></p>
<p>unique philosophy, close collaboration with <span class="caps">CS</span> and <span class="caps">IACS</span>, advisory board, internships, close mentoring</p>
<p><strong>Do I need a <span class="caps">BA</span> in Linguistics or Computer Science?</strong><br>
You need a <span class="caps">BA</span>, but we do not require a <span class="caps">BA</span> in a specific field.
Computational linguistics is very diverse, so suitable applicants can come from very different backgrounds.
Besides the obvious choices of linguistics and computer science, there’s also mathematics, philosophy, sociology, or digital humanities, to name just a few.
We do not rank applications based on how closely related the degree is to computational linguistics, but on how likely the applicant is to make for a great computational linguist.</br></p>
<p><strong>So you teach to the lowest common denominator and if I already know linguistics and programming I won’t learn anything new?</strong><br>
No.
It is true that we aim to accommodate students from very different backgrounds.
But the courses are structured in such a way that more experienced students will learn new things, too.
For example, <em>Computational Linguistics 1</em> acts as an introduction to Python in general, but it also covers specialized packages like <span class="caps">NLTK</span> that are specific to computational linguistics.
Similarly, <em>Mathematical Methods</em> covers important mathematical concepts, but links them to specific applications in computational linguistics that even a mathematics or computer science <span class="caps">BA</span> won’t have seen before.</br></p>
<p><strong>But I already had several computational linguistics classes as an undergrad, your intro classes really are too basic for me!</strong><br>
We recognize that some exceptional students may already have an unusually rich background in certain areas.
All students will be closely mentored to ensure optimal progression through the 3 semesters of the program.
As part of this, every incoming student has to take basic skill assessment at the beginning of the first semester.
Based on your performance, you and the M.A program director then decide if it makes sense for you to deviate from the standard course progression and substitute a more advanced class for one of the introductory courses.</br></p>
<p><strong>I don’t know any programming. Do I have a chance against the other applicants?</strong><br> Yes.</br></p>
<p>First of all, keep in mind that computational linguistics involves lots of programming and computational data analysis, but not every computational linguistics job needs a software engineer.
Often an intermediate level of programming is enough to be a productive team member, and this level is not that hard to reach.</p>
<p>That said, we do pay close attention to whether an applicant is likely to possess the formal reasoning skills that are indispensable for programming.
But this does not mean that we are looking for previous programming experience.
If you have completed a programming course, that is an obvious piece of evidence of your aptitude, but there’s also others:
Did you enjoy syntax or formal semantics?
What about a formal logic class?
Or maybe statistics?
A course that requires the ability to apply a formal system in a precise manner is a decent indicator of how hard it will be for you to learn some programming.</p>
<p><strong>I hate math. Should I consider a career in computational linguistics?</strong><br>
It depends.
If your beef is with the typical number crunching of high school mathematics, then you do not need to worry because computational linguistics has very little of that.
However, if your dislike for mathematics stems more from a general dislike for abstract systems, then computational linguistics may not be to your liking.
Do you enjoy formal linguistics courses (syntax, semantics), programming, or analytical philosophy?
Then the odds are pretty good that you’ll handle the math-heavier parts of computational linguistics just fine.</br></p>
<p><strong>Can I be enrolled in the program and still work a full-time job?</strong><br>
No.
Enrolled students are expected to spend a lot of time at the department —- not just for classes, but also for extracurricular activities, meetings with the program director, talks and social events, and so on.
Most of that takes place on weekdays between 9am and 6pm, which is incompatible with a regular work schedule.</br></p>
<p><strong>But isn’t practical experience very important for landing a job?</strong><br>
True, and that is why we make a concerted effort to organize internships for students during the summer break between the second and third semester.</br></p>
<p><strong>I want to be a research scientist, should I go for a Ph.D. instead?</strong>
A Ph.D. is a hard requirement for a researcher position in academia.
For research groups in industry a Ph.D. is usually a strong advantage, but not always necessary.
A reasonable strategy is to first get an <span class="caps">M.A.</span> in Computational Linguistics to test the waters.
If after one year you are absolutely sure that you enjoy doing research in this area, you can apply for admission into a Ph.D. program. </p>
<p><strong>Can I transfer from the <span class="caps">M.A.</span> program into the Linguistics Ph.D. program at Stony Brook?</strong>
Yes and no.
You can apply for admission to the Ph.D. even if you are already enrolled in the <span class="caps">M.A.</span> program.
But your application will be evaluated as any other among the pool of applicants, being in the <span class="caps">M.A.</span> program does not grant you any special status. 
Keep in mind that the Ph.D. program is very competitive and accepts only a small percentage of all applicants.
Students who want to pursue a Ph.D. program after their <span class="caps">M.A.</span> are encouraged to consult with the <span class="caps">M.A.</span> program director to identify several suitable programs across the country, and to apply to all of them to maximize their chances.</p>
<h3 id="application">Application</h3>
<p><strong>So what does the ideal candidate look like?</strong><br>
There is no such thing as an ideal candidate because computational linguistics is a broad field that covers very different kinds of activities and job profiles.
The most important thing is that your application conveys that you have at least a rudimentary idea of what computational linguistics is like.
This means having had prior exposure to the idea that language can be studied as a formal system, comparable to what is covered in an introductory course in linguistics.
And it means having had some basic training in computational, algorithmic thinking, which covers a wide range of courses from philosophy over linguistics to computer science and mathematics.</br></p>
<p><strong>Is there anything I can do to strengthen my application?</strong><br>
fixme: expand</br></p>
<ul>
<li>take linguistics course</li>
<li>take an analytical course</li>
<li>do some statistics</li>
<li>show initiative<ul>
<li>online courses</li>
<li>code combat</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When should I apply?</strong><br>
Admission decisions are made on a rolling basis starting <strong>March 1</strong>, and no applications will be accepted after <strong>April 15</strong>.
Ideally, you will submit your application before the end of February.
Once all the slots for a given year are filled, it is very difficult to admit additional students even if their application is very strong.
For international students, an early application is particularly important because of the additional time that is needed for the visa process.</br></p>
<p><strong>What should I submit as my writing sample?</strong><br>
The writing sample serves multiple purposes.
It demonstrates your ability to work on a larger project, to reason in a systematic fashion, and to clearly communicate your ideas to others.
Computational linguistics is unique compared to other disciplines because the project may not just take the form of a small research project but could also be built around a programming project.
This is why we accept two different kinds of writing samples (only one of the two should be submitted):</br></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Scientific paper</em><br>
   This is a mini-research paper.
   It applies a specific scientific or mathematical technique to a small, narrowly defined topic.
   The writing sample will be evaluated based on the clarity of writing, strength of argumentation, correct usage of scientific methods, and appropriate citation of relevant literature.
   Length varies between subfields, but should not exceed 16 pages.</br></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Programming project</em><br>
   This is a short documentation (~2 pages) of a decently sized programming project the applicant has worked on or is currently working on.
   The documentation must include a link to the source code, ideally on a public hosting platform such as <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>.
   If the applicant is not the sole author of the code, their specific contributions must be clearly indicated.
   The documentation should describe the general problem to be solved and important design aspects of the solution.
   It may also include future plans for new features.</br></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Do <span class="caps">GRE</span> scores matter?</strong><br>
The <span class="caps">GRE</span> is required for every graduate program at Stony Brook University.
<span class="caps">GRE</span> scores are only a small part of the application package and not nearly as important as the letters of recommendation and the writing sample.</br></p>
<p><strong>Do I have to take the <span class="caps">GRE</span> Mathematics Subject Test?</strong><br>
No, only the standard <span class="caps">GRE</span> is required.</br></p>
<p><strong>Do I have to provide <span class="caps">IELTS</span> or <span class="caps">TOEFL</span> scores?</strong><br>
All international students at Stony Brook University are required to demonstrate sufficient proficiency in English.
For additional details, consult the <a href="http://sb.cc.stonybrook.edu/gradbulletin/current/admissions/requirements/english.php">Graduate Bulletin</a>.</br></p>
<p><strong>Is there any financial support to cover the tuition?</strong><br>
Unfortunately Stony Brook University only offers financial support for Ph.D. students at this point.
However, we hope to offer privately funded stipends for <span class="caps">M.A.</span> students in the future. </br></p>
<p><strong>I still have some questions. Who should I contact?</strong><br>
All questions related to the Computational Linguistics <span class="caps">M.A.</span> program should be sent to the <span class="caps">M.A.</span> program director:</br></p>

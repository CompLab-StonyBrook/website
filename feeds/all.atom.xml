&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
Deep neural networks have proven to be highly successful at
learning many linguistic patterns, including morphological mappings (e.g.,
work → worked), but their internal representations and processes remain
largely opaque. In this talk, I describe a class of encoder-decoder
networks that contain explicit representations of linguistic structures,
such as stems and affixes, and whose processing steps can be
straightforwardly understood as gradient application of elementary symbolic
operations (e.g., reading and writing segments, overwriting of vowel
melodies, stem extraction). Because all of the computations of these models
are differentiable, they can be trained by gradient descent or other
numerical optimization algorithms. Across a wide range of case studies —
including operations of infixation, transfixation, and reduplication that
have been challenging and unwieldy for previous models — the networks
succeed in learning accurate and linguistically-interpretable analyses from
unannotated examples of morphological mappings (e.g., [work, worked],
[tristi, trumisti], [ʃamar, ʃimri], or [bagawen,&amp;nbsp;babagawen]).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="talk"></category><category term="morphology"></category><category term="learning"></category></entry><entry><title>Mehryar Mohri IACS Talk</title><link href="http://compling.stonybrook.edu/news/event/mehryar-mohri-iacs-talk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>CompLab</name></author><id>tag:compling.stonybrook.edu,2018-09-13:/news/event/mehryar-mohri-iacs-talk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At this weeks &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IACS&lt;/span&gt; seminar series, Mehryar Mohri (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt;/Google) will discuss how weighted automata can be used for online&amp;nbsp;learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
This talk discusses a general framework for online learning with
expert advice where regret is defined with respect to a dynamic set of
experts represented by a weighted automata.  This framework is highly
relevant to applications and covers many previous&amp;nbsp;studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a series of algorithms for this problem including an
automata-based algorithm extending weighted-majority. We also give a
more efficient algorithm drawing from automata theory tools and
algorithms. We further present efficient algorithms based on an
approximation of the competitor weighted automaton, in particular
, n-gram models obtained by minimizing the infinite-Renyi divergence,
and present an extensive study of the approximation properties of such
models. Finally, we also extend our algorithms and results to the
framework of sleeping experts.  Finally, we show that our
approximation methods can be extended to online convex optimization
and a general mirror descent&amp;nbsp;setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="talk"></category><category term="learning"></category><category term="formal language theory"></category></entry><entry><title>Computational Courses in Fall 2018</title><link href="http://compling.stonybrook.edu/news/news/computational-courses-in-fall-2018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>CompLab</name></author><id>tag:compling.stonybrook.edu,2018-08-20:/news/news/computational-courses-in-fall-2018.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following graduate courses in computational linguistics will be offered in our department this&amp;nbsp;semester:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/KyleGorman.html"&gt;Kyle Gorman&lt;/a&gt; will be giving a Frontiers talk in our department on November 29 at 4:00pm.
Kyle got his Ph.D. in Linguistics from Penn University in 2013 and is now working in Google&amp;#8217;s research group on natural language processing in New York.
One of the big splits in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NLP&lt;/span&gt; is the divide between hand-crafted resources and automatically trained machine models.
In his talk, Kyle will contrast the usefulness of these two approaches for text&amp;nbsp;normalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title and abstract are&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="minimally-supervised-text-normalization-algorithms-and-implementation"&gt;Minimally supervised text normalization: algorithms and&amp;nbsp;implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text normalization refers to methods used to convert text input from written (e.g., &amp;#8220;$2.50&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;5:15pm&amp;#8221;) to spoken form (&amp;#8220;two dollars and fifty cents&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;five fifteen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;), primarily, though not exclusively, as part of a text-to-speech synthesis engine.
Unlike much of modern natural language processing, much of this process is currently accomplished using hand-written language-specific grammars rather than general-purpose machine learning engines, hindering our ability to scale.
In the first half of the talk, I describe experiments on learning text normalization for cardinal and ordinal numbers (Gorman &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Sproat 2016), which accounts for much of the complexity of these language-specific grammars.
The first model I describe uses an end-to-end recurrent neural network.
The second model, drawing inspiration from the linguistics literature, uses finite-state transducers constructed with a minimal amount of training data. 
While both models achieve near-perfect performance, the latter model can be trained using several orders of magnitude less data than the former, making it particularly useful for low-resource languages.
I also describe some extensions of this work to other classes such as currency and time expressions.
The second half of the talk will discuss Pynini (Gorman 2016), an open-source Python library for grammar compilation, which is used to implement minimally supervised text normalization grammar induction.
I will review the design of this library and provide several tutorial examples drawn from&amp;nbsp;morphophonology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This talk draws from work done in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/RichardSproat.html"&gt;Richard Sproat&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="invited speaker"></category><category term="NLP"></category></entry></feed>

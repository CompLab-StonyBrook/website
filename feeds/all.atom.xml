Learning with Partially Ordered&amp;nbsp;Representations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
When generalizing, and making compact hypotheses from sparse and
impoverished data, learning algorithms often rely on domain-specific
representations or features. Often these features pose a learning problem,
by exponentially increasing the number of hypotheses which correctly
describe data. However, features also give the learner an advantage, by
structuring the space of hypotheses in a particular way.  This structure
gives rise to certain entailments between grammars, which I show using
several linguistic examples - text recognition, speech analysis, and
syntactic adjunction. I discuss how learners can exploit this structure to
make inferences, and introduce a non-statistical learning method that
provably identifies the responsible constraints. Integration and comparison
of these insights into statistical learning is ongoing&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="talk"></category><category term="learning"></category></entry><entry><title>Joint Frontiers/NLP Talk by Ryan Cotterell</title><link href="http://compling.stonybrook.edu/news/event/joint-frontiersnlp-talk-by-ryan-cotterell.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-11-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>CompLab</name></author><id>tag:compling.stonybrook.edu,2018-11-11:/news/event/joint-frontiersnlp-talk-by-ryan-cotterell.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ryancotterell.github.io/"&gt;Ryan Cotterell&lt;/a&gt; will give a talk on Monday, November 12, at 4pm in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IACS&lt;/span&gt; seminar room.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;/strong&gt;
Probabilistic Typology: Deep Generative Models of Vowel&amp;nbsp;Inventories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
Linguistic typology studies the range of structures present in human
language. The main goal of the field is to discover which sets of possible
phenomena are universal, and which are merely frequent. For example, all
languages have vowels, while most—but not all—languages have an [u] sound.
In this paper we present the first probabilistic treatment of a basic
question in phonological typology: What makes a natural vowel inventory? We
introduce a series of deep stochastic point processes, and contrast them
with previous computational, simulation-based approaches. We provide a
comprehensive suite of experiments on over 200 distinct&amp;nbsp;languages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="talk"></category><category term="phonology"></category></entry><entry><title>IACS Info Session</title><link href="http://compling.stonybrook.edu/news/event/iacs-info-session.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-11T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>CompLab</name></author><id>tag:compling.stonybrook.edu,2018-10-11:/news/event/iacs-info-session.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Consider attending the &lt;a href="https://calendar.stonybrook.edu/site/iacs/event/iacs-information-session/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IACS&lt;/span&gt; info session&lt;/a&gt; for computationally minded graduate students.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
Deep neural networks have proven to be highly successful at
learning many linguistic patterns, including morphological mappings (e.g.,
work → worked), but their internal representations and processes remain
largely opaque. In this talk, I describe a class of encoder-decoder
networks that contain explicit representations of linguistic structures,
such as stems and affixes, and whose processing steps can be
straightforwardly understood as gradient application of elementary symbolic
operations (e.g., reading and writing segments, overwriting of vowel
melodies, stem extraction). Because all of the computations of these models
are differentiable, they can be trained by gradient descent or other
numerical optimization algorithms. Across a wide range of case studies —
including operations of infixation, transfixation, and reduplication that
have been challenging and unwieldy for previous models — the networks
succeed in learning accurate and linguistically-interpretable analyses from
unannotated examples of morphological mappings (e.g., [work, worked],
[tristi, trumisti], [ʃamar, ʃimri], or [bagawen,&amp;nbsp;babagawen]).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="talk"></category><category term="morphology"></category><category term="learning"></category></entry><entry><title>Mehryar Mohri IACS Talk</title><link href="http://compling.stonybrook.edu/news/event/mehryar-mohri-iacs-talk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-09-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>CompLab</name></author><id>tag:compling.stonybrook.edu,2018-09-13:/news/event/mehryar-mohri-iacs-talk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At this weeks &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IACS&lt;/span&gt; seminar series, Mehryar Mohri (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt;/Google) will discuss how weighted automata can be used for online&amp;nbsp;learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;
This talk discusses a general framework for online learning with
expert advice where regret is defined with respect to a dynamic set of
experts represented by a weighted automata.  This framework is highly
relevant to applications and covers many previous&amp;nbsp;studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present a series of algorithms for this problem including an
automata-based algorithm extending weighted-majority. We also give a
more efficient algorithm drawing from automata theory tools and
algorithms. We further present efficient algorithms based on an
approximation of the competitor weighted automaton, in particular
, n-gram models obtained by minimizing the infinite-Renyi divergence,
and present an extensive study of the approximation properties of such
models. Finally, we also extend our algorithms and results to the
framework of sleeping experts.  Finally, we show that our
approximation methods can be extended to online convex optimization
and a general mirror descent&amp;nbsp;setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="talk"></category><category term="learning"></category><category term="formal language theory"></category></entry><entry><title>Computational Courses in Fall 2018</title><link href="http://compling.stonybrook.edu/news/news/computational-courses-in-fall-2018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-20T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>CompLab</name></author><id>tag:compling.stonybrook.edu,2018-08-20:/news/news/computational-courses-in-fall-2018.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The following graduate courses in computational linguistics will be offered in our department this&amp;nbsp;semester:&lt;/p&gt;

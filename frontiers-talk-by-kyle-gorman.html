<p><a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/KyleGorman.html">Kyle Gorman</a> will be giving a Frontiers talk in our department on November 29 at 4:00pm.
Kyle got his Ph.D. in Linguistics from Penn University in 2013 and is now working in Google&#8217;s research group on natural language processing in New York.
One of the big splits in <span class="caps">NLP</span> is the divide between hand-crafted resources and automatically trained machine models.
In his talk, Kyle will contrast the usefulness of these two approaches for text&nbsp;normalization.</p>
<p>The title and abstract are&nbsp;below.</p>
<h2 id="minimally-supervised-text-normalization-algorithms-and-implementation">Minimally supervised text normalization: algorithms and&nbsp;implementation</h2>
<p>Text normalization refers to methods used to convert text input from written (e.g., &#8220;$2.50&#8221;, &#8220;5:15pm&#8221;) to spoken form (&#8220;two dollars and fifty cents&#8221;, &#8220;five fifteen <span class="caps">PM</span>&#8221;), primarily, though not exclusively, as part of a text-to-speech synthesis engine.
Unlike much of modern natural language processing, much of this process is currently accomplished using hand-written language-specific grammars rather than general-purpose machine learning engines, hindering our ability to scale.
In the first half of the talk, I describe experiments on learning text normalization for cardinal and ordinal numbers (Gorman <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Sproat 2016), which accounts for much of the complexity of these language-specific grammars.
The first model I describe uses an end-to-end recurrent neural network.
The second model, drawing inspiration from the linguistics literature, uses finite-state transducers constructed with a minimal amount of training data. 
While both models achieve near-perfect performance, the latter model can be trained using several orders of magnitude less data than the former, making it particularly useful for low-resource languages.
I also describe some extensions of this work to other classes such as currency and time expressions.
The second half of the talk will discuss Pynini (Gorman 2016), an open-source Python library for grammar compilation, which is used to implement minimally supervised text normalization grammar induction.
I will review the design of this library and provide several tutorial examples drawn from&nbsp;morphophonology.</p>

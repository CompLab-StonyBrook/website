As part of the [Computational Phonology class (LIN 626)](http://lin626.thomasgraf.net) we hosted an end-of-semester workshop on December 12, 2016.
This was a great opportunity for students to present their computational research, and many of the projects have since been presented at prominent conferences (e.g. [CLS 53](http://chicagolinguisticsociety.org/public/CLS53_Booklet.pdf)).
We also had an invited talk by [Adam Jardine](http://rci.rutgers.edu/~aj591/).
